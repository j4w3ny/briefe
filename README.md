# Briefe

Briefe, "letter" in German(Deutsch).

Briefe provides you a untrackable, encrypted, and secure way to send and receive long messages with your friends. Your every message will be turned into a NFT, encrypted with your own private key.

## Architecture

- Sender
- Receiver
- The Briefe Contract

## Workflow

Both Sender and Receiver should register on the Briefe Contract.

Once the registration is done, the Sender can send a message to the Receiver.

Data will be stored at IPFS/Arvear and the hash will be stored at the Briefe Contract.

By design, once Sender submit a message, it will automatically redirect the message hash to Receiver.

To achieve privacy and protect the correction, the message will be encrypted by Receivers' public key (which called address in Ethereum) with hash generated by Senders' private key when it's submit, and decrypted by Receivers' private key and verify with Senders' public key when it's received.

## Features

- Untrackable (Only message hash and room id is stored in the Briefe Contract)
- Decentralized (Control at your own)
- Email-like experience (Use it like an email client)
